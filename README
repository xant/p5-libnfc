Libnfc version 0.01
===================

perl bindings for libnfc.
This module aims to provide an high-level OO api to access mifare rfid tags
(and in general all readers and tags supported by libnfc).

You can obviously access the procedural api exposed by the C library 
which has been fully mapped within the perl context

NOTE : 
    This module has been updated to work with the development
    version of libnfc (the one on the svn repository).
    The API has been slightly changed so, if you want
    to build this module against a stable libnfc release (<= 1.2.1),
    you need to remove -DLIBNFC_DEV from Makefile.PL

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
