Libnfc version 0.01
===================

perl bindings for libnfc.
This module aims to provide an high-level OO api to access mifare rfid tags
(and in general all readers and tags supported by libnfc).

You can obviously access the procedural api exposed by the C library 
which has been fully mapped within the perl context

NOTE : 
    This module has been updated to work with last libnfc stable
    (1.3.3 when I'm writing this)
    Hopefully libnfc API is now stable and won't drastically change
    in the next realeases. Support for older versions of libnfc
    have been dropped with version 0.6 of this perl module

FURTHER NOTE: 
    Actually only support for mifare classics and ultralights have been
    implemented. The design of this package should anyway simplify 
    writing implementations for all other tags supported by libnfc
    (perhaps there could be need to map some more structures in Libnfc.xx,
     but that's quite a straightforward task)

INSTALLATION

First ensure installing libnfc >= 1.3.3 on the system and make it available
in system-wide library/include dirs. If you are installing it on a different
location you could need to apply some changes to Makefile.PL to skip autodetection
of libnfc location and to correctly point your custom location)

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
